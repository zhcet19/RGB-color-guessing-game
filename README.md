# RGB-color-guessing-game
* Its a color predicting game in which you have to predict the colors resulting from the combination of primary colors.
* Its a color guessing game based on the fact that every color is a combination of three primary color 
 red,green and blue. I have used JavaScript(vanilla JS),Html and CSS for this project. This game aims to develop the color predicting    ability of a person as the game generates random color each time and also adds curiosity to an individual to find the possible color  formed due to random combination of primary color.
